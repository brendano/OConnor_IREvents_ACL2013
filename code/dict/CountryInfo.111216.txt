<!-- CountryInfo.txt

CountryInfo.txt is a general purpose file intended to facilitate natural language 
processing of news reports and political texts. It was originally developed to identify 
states for the text filtering system used in the development of MID4, then extended
to incorporate CIA World Factbook and WordNet information for the development of
TABARI dictionaries.

OVERALL FORMAT:

This is almost but not quite XML: major fields are delimited with tags of the form
<tag>...</tag>. When there are multiple entries inside a tag, these are simply
delimited by individual lines, which is not XML but converting this would be a relatively 
simple exercise well within the programming capabilities of anyone who would be working  
with the program in the first place.

# indicates that everything following is a comment

This block of documentation, however, is delimited using XML &lt;!-- ... --&gt;

Names of the form {...} {...} indicate synonyms for the same individual. These are very
incomplete: see notes below on name forms.  

DATE FORMATS:

These are variations of the TABARI format. Generally dates have the form YYYYMMDD.
The following notations are used:
[B: date]      Birth date [YYYY0101 indicates this was known only to the year, though
               occasionally individuals might have been born that day]
[D: date]      Death date [same conventions as birth]
[date - date]  Occupied office during this interval
[>date]        Occupied office after this date
[date]         Currently occupying the office, starting with this date

TAGGED FIELDS:

<Country>:     wrapper for individual countries
<CountryCode>: ISO-3166-alpha3 code
<CountryName>: Country name in English

<COW-Alpha>:         Correlates of War project alpha code. --- = no code
<COW-Numeric>        Correlates of War project numerical code. 000 = no code
<FIPS-10>:           FIPS-10 code (2 character code used in the U.S. government)  -- = no code
<IMF>:   			 IMF numeric code. 000 = no code
<ISO3166-numeric>:   ISO3166-1 numeric code. 000 = no code
<ISO3166-alpha2>:    ISO3166-alpha2 code --- = no code
<ISO3166-alpha3>:    ISO3166-alpha3 code --- = no code

<Nationality>: This contains one or more adjectival forms of the country name, plus
               any number of synonyms, both in English and other languages
               
<Capital>: One or more names for the capital city

<MajorCities>: usually cities with populations greater than 1-million; occasionally
               other major cities
               
<Regions>: Regions listed as WordNet meronyms

<GeogFeatures>: Geographical features listed as WordNet meronyms

<Leaders>: original source was http://rulers.org, with some additional updates from the
           CIA World Factbook. Sub-tags give the name of the position. Leaders are from
           roughly 1960 to around 2009.
            
<Government>: Source was the CIA World Leaders website
                  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/index.html
              The title of the position as reported by the source follows the #
              the date is preceded by a CAMEO actor code indicating the position

CAVEATS AND KNOWN ISSUES

1. For starters, keep in mind that this is a very large file assembled from a variety
   of sources by a variety of people (as well as automated programs which extracted 
   information from some of those sources which typically were almost but not quite
   consistently formatted), and it will DEFINITELY CONTAIN ERRORS! So use it with
   caution, and if you find some mistakes (particularly big ones), please let us know.
   
2. Constructing and determining equivalences of names is a huge issue. In most cases, you 
   will probably want to use these as a starting point for doing more sophisticated name 
   resolution, mostly to determine whether a partial name corresponds to someone on these
   lists (and, very occasionally, resolving a name that occurs in multiple countries to the
   appropriate country).
   
   The EU JRC-Names database notes:
   
	  64% of the names in JRC-Names do not have additional spelling variants. For 
	  28% of the names, JRC-Names knows two or three spellings. There are 3760 
	  entities with ten spellings or more, and 37 entities with over 100 spelling 
	  variants. The names with the most spelling variants are Muammar Gaddafi (413 spellings),
	  Mikhail Saakashvili (256) and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (246) (status July 2011).
	  
   This is for the full names alone -- various combinations of initials and partial names
   would probably increase this by at least a factor of four.

3. Note that this uses a UTF-8 encoding, so the names do not include diacritical marks. 
   Sorry, but in the process of converting various file formats, we just couldn't keep 
   track of these consistently, so we dropped them. As does the current version of 
   JRC-Names,so probably that was probably the right call. A future version of JRC-Names 
   may have these, and this could be used to recover the original form[s].

4. The former Yugoslavia, as always, is a mess -- we still haven't figured out a really
   good way to deal with this.
   
5. If you convert this to a syntactically correct XML file, we'd appreciate receiving
   a copy of that (and, while you are at it, the code of doing the conversion?)
   

AVAILABLE ANCILLARY PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES

translate.countryinfo.pl: converts this to a TABARI 0.7 dictionary; it also uses the 
    [B: and [D: files to assign *ELI ("elite") codes 

Matthias Heilke has some programs for translating text versions of the monthly CIA World
Leaders (https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/) files into this 
format and reconciling these with the existing file; with a little more work this could 
be converted to a system which automatically updates the file.

The EU Joint Research Centre (those great folks who give us European Media Monitor)
maintains a very large and multi-lingual list of political names at
 
            http://langtech.jrc.ec.europa.eu/JRC-Names.html.
             
This web site also links to an excellent paper on the technical challenges involved with 
name detection and resolution.

From Vincent Arel-Bundock:

The "countrycode" package for R includes a set of regular expressions which can be used to 
match country names in character strings to country codes.
