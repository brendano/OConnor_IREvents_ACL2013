UN Security Council resolution 1344 (2001), imposing mandatory UN sanctions 
in relation to Liberia, was adopted on 7  March 2001. The resolution was 
co-sponsored by the UK and US in response to the findings of the UN Expert 
Panel on Sierra Leone on violations of the Sierra Leone arms embargo and the 
link between the trade in diamonds and arms. The Security Council determined 
that the active support provided by the Government of Liberia for armed rebel 
groups in neighbouring countries, and in particular the RUF in Sierra Leone, 
constitutes a threat to international peace and security in the region.

A choice of celebratory New Year drinks seemed the most obvious division between 
opposing units of Bosnian soldiers toasting 1996 on Monday. NATO had some of 
Bosnia's soldiers where it wanted them on a first New Year's day of peace -- 
away from the frontline drinking to a future out of uniform. The first U.S 
armoured cavalry troops in Bosnia are using an old collective farm with a 
crop dusters' airstrip as a forward base for enforcing peace in the volatile 
northeast. U.S military convoys rolled over the Sava river bridge into Bosnia on 
Monday but numbers dropped to avoid creating a New Year's day army traffic jam.
The first hint of a challenge to the authority of the NATO peace mission to 
Bosnia emerged with a report that separatist Serbs had seized 11 civilians 
travelling on roads in Sarajavo opened by peacekeepers.
